## Goals

This repository is a collection of data structures and algorithms I wanted to make so I can practice them. In my day-to-day job, I rarely use any complicated data structures or algorithms and I want to keep my theoretical CS skills up to snuff.

There may be other things in here than just data structures or algorithms if I want to add it.

## Packages

### Aviary

Messing around with combinators

### Composite

Data structures that hold one or a couple things but are not really equivalent to arrays or things like that.

### Linear

Data structures that are array-like.

### Tree (TBD)

### Graph (TBD)
